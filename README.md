# Data Exploratry Playground

### The Situation

I love data. So this repo saved some of my Jupyter Notebooks. 

### The Task

We would like to explore if there is any interesting trend, previously unkwown patterns in these data.


### The Action

Just exploring the data, and also filling up missing value. 


## Installation

The tool is developed based on Python 3. We recommend using a virtual environment to run the program. To run the Jupyter Notebook, please run the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
pip install jupyter
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
